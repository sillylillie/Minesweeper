# TODO write a testing suite to run this over a long period to get data
# I want this testing suite to iterate over all possible starting locations of each board
# It should generate a percentage of how likely you are to get a playable board with no guessing
# Ideal boards can be completed 100% of the time with no guessing
# There might be a range from 1% to 99%
# I expect many in the 0% to 1% range: board which have one guessing spot that can 
# be fixed only when the user starts exactly there

# Dependency: makes little sense before the data gathering listed below is implemented
# Q: does it matter that the displaced bombs on the first click will be randomly placed elsewhere?
